        <p>Election Commission of mvgr proposes a new system of voting where everything is transparent and no question
          of tampering the voting machine as it doesn't exists in first place.</p>

        <p>The position of College President is one of the most important positions in any academic institution. The President represents the students and faculty, oversees the administration of the college, and works to ensure that the college is fulfilling its mission and goals. The candidates that we have here today are all highly qualified and are passionate about making a positive impact on the college community.</p>
        <p>Regards,
